    		<p id="historyParagraph">Ukrainian history is very complex, both saddening and hopeful. Ukrainians would for hundreds of years defend their own land and identity. Ukraine has fought against, is still fighting against, and will continue to fight against those who want to destroy Ukraine in ways such as occupying land or stealing history in an attempt to call Ukraine "a mistake". Ukraine has been under the occupation of nations such as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Muscovy/Russian Empire, which have always only cared for power, turning into monsters when anybody brought up the idea of a free Ukraine. Ukraine has been surrounded by enemies since the very beginning. During the times of the Cossacks, Ukraine would ally with one nation, then when that nation refused Ukrainian freedom, it would ally with another nation, and this was the pattern. A strong Ukrainian identity started developing in the 15th century with the Cossacks (who spread the name "Ukraine") and went on from there. Below we give you a brief summary of Ukrainian history, containing the most important names and dates. Ukraine developed through the nations of Kyivan Rus', Halychyna (or Ruthenia), Hetmanshchyna, and later official Ukrainian states. All of these names will be mentioned in the summary. At the top of this page, you can see a Topics section with a search bar. Here you will be able to look into Ukrainian history with more detail by searching the name of a certain event. You will be provided sources, such as websites or videos, to better understand a topic (Ukrainian sources are translated). The Encyclopedia of Ukraine is the most used source of Ukrainian information and will appear as a source for most topics. Most sources are Ukrainian. We hope that after exploring this section you will understand more about Ukraine and Ukrainians and that you will be able to hold proper conversations with them.</p>

            <img src="Trypillia.jpg" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Trypillia: 5,000 - 2,500 BCE</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">The first civilization on Ukrainian, Moldovan, and Romanian land—some could say in Europe—is Trypillia, also called Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, named after villages in Ukraine and Romania. Not much can be said about Trypillia because of its ancient time period, but what has been discovered is fascinating. The overall beginnings of Cucuteni-Trypillia were a migration from the Balkans and settlement in today's lands of Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania, with the largest sites being in Ukraine. The people of Trypillia would build oval-shaped settlements with beautiful architecture. These settlements are also called "mega-structures" or "megasites," reaching up to 320 hectares. In the settlement, there would be smaller homes and, once in a while, a larger home where possibly larger families or elders would live; this was some sort of pattern in Trypillian architecture. Trypillia is especially known for its pottery and figures reflecting its beliefs. In Trypillian culture, a woman was considered a very important person, a "goddess". This is assumed from Trypillian figures; it is thought that they had their own gods and important symbols. Trypillians had an interesting practice of burning their homes and even entire settlements when moving to a new area; it cannot be said exactly why they did this, but it seems as if they did not want us finding their culture. Maybe it is because of this practice that we are unable to figure out more about the Trypillians; in fact, most of what has been found of Trypillia has been burned. The most common explanation for the burning of their own homes is ritual practice. Trypillians did not have a system of writing; instead, they used symbols and drawings of different kinds of animals, humans (mostly female), and unique swirly designs on pottery and figures. The Ukrainian archaeologist of Czech origin, Vikentiy Khvoyka, is most often credited with discovering the Trypillia culture on Ukrainian lands in 1896. Other names who have dedicated their time to learning more about Trypillia are Volodymyr Kruts, Oleksandr Spitsyn, Serhiy Bibikov, Vsevolod Markevych, and Tetyana Passek. Today, the "Historical and Cultural Reserve of Trypillian Culture," located in Lehedzyne, Ukraine, is one of the best places to go if you want to learn more about Trypillia and look at their amazing artifacts. Before Trypillia, on the territory of Ukraine, there existed the Boh-Dnister culture and the Dnieper-Donets culture, which some archaeologists say could have influenced the development of Trypillia. Many "cultures" came after Trypillia which will not be mentioned here.</p>

            <img src="UkraineGeography.jpg" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Inhabitants of Ukraine Before Kyivan Rus'</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">The first known people, by name, on the southern steppes of Ukraine were Cimmerians; no cities remain from them, but descriptions and images were made by ancient Greeks. The first overall "state" on Ukrainian land were the well-known Scythians, warriors of the steppes; they were the people who took over Cimmerian land. Today, Ukraine owns many ancient artifacts of the Scythians, most known for their gold, that are displayed in museums. It is believed that the Scythians were some of the first people to domesticate horses and use them effectively in battle. There are interesting connections that can be made between the Ukrainian and Scythian languages. The end of Scythia was met on today's Ukrainian lands. After the Scythians, Ukrainian lands were inhabitated by, or simply replaced by, Sarmatians and Venedy (also known as Venedi, Veneti, or Wends); these people are some of the earliest Slavs, dating from 500 BCE to 400 CE. The Goths (200–400 CE) took over Sarmatia and Venedy for a short while until they were conquered by the Hunnic Empire (400–500 CE). The Antes state (6th century) is considered one of the earliest Slavic states, the ancestors of Ukrainians. It was at around this time that Kyiv, today's capital of Ukraine, was founded. Later, Turkic Avars, Bulgars, Khazars (700–900 CE), and Polovtsians (800–1200 CE) took control of Ukrainian territory. Other Slavic groups which became Ukrainian and other Slavic nations ancestry divided and became Polans (Polyany or Polianians), Siverianians, Derevlianians, and Dulibians (Buzhanians or Volhynians), leading to the development of Kyivan Rus'.</p>

            <p class="BriefParagraph">Kyiv is one of Ukraine's oldest cities, thought to have been founded in the year <strong>482 CE</strong>, which is today recognized as the official founding date of Kyiv. It is today's capital and most populous city in Ukraine, with a rich history. Kyiv became one of the most powerful cities as the main city of Kyivan Rus', one of the most powerful East Slavic states in Europe at the time, lasting from around 880 to 1240 CE until it broke apart into many different states because of the Mongol invasion and Kyiv was destroyed. According to a legend that appeared in Kyivan Rus', Kyiv was founded by Prince Kyi of the Slavic state of Polans with his brothers Shchek and Khoryv, as well as his sister Lybid'. The name of the city was given after Kyi, the oldest of the brothers, who is considered the founder of the city. In Kyiv, monuments to Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv, and Lybid' was put up based on this story. Kyiv remained an important city after Kyivan Rus', before being capital city of the Polianians, then Rus'; Principality of Kyiv and later of Ukrainian states. Some important structures in Kyiv that stand today or have been rebuilt are the Saint Sophia Cathedral, the Golden Gate, and monasteries such as Pechersk Lavra Monastery and St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery. Many other monuments are also important to Kyiv and Ukrainian history, such as the Ukrainian Motherland Monument, Independence Monument, Bohdan Khmelnytsky Monument, Taras Shevchenko Monument, and monuments to Volodymyr the Great. The historical importance of Kyiv led to it becoming today's beloved capital of Ukraine.</p>

            <img src="KyivskaRus'.jpeg" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Kyivan Rus': 880 - 1240 CE</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">Kyivan Rus' was the largest and most powerful Slavic state of its time, containing multiple principalities; it is also labeled as the first East Slavic state. Kyivan Rus' is very important to the development of Ukraine; the name "Ukraine" first appeared on this territory around the 12th century to refer to a certain part of Kyivan Rus' that is today Ukrainian land. It is also important to know that this territory was not called "Kyivan" inside the state itself but just simply Rus' with a soft s. The name Kyivan Rus' was later given to this territory by historians to refer to this state; Kyivan because Kyiv was the main city of this state, today's territory of Ukraine was the heartland of Kyivan Rus. Keep in mind "Rus" is not the same thing as Russia, but rather referred to "Rusyny" which was a name for early Ukrainians, while today's Russians were called "Muscovites". The name "Rus" has different possible origins; some historians point its roots to the Vikings, while others say it is of Slavic origin; we cannot be sure. In Latin, Rus' is also known as Ruthenia, which will be the name most associated with Halychyna after the collapse of Rus'. Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia have claimed Kyivan Rus' as their origins; however, some of today's Russians say "Rus' is Russia," which is nothing more than a lie that spread throughout the Russian Empire beginning in the 15th century. In reality, Russia, or more accurately, Muscovy, started as a small region in Rus' that developed into a principality that had been heavily influenced by the Golden Horde and Finno-Ugric people, while Ukraine has more connections to Rus' as seen today. One of the main sources of information about Rus' during the time period itself is the writings of Nestor, or "Nestor the Chronicler" who completed writing the Chronicle of Rus', which is named "The Tale of Bygone Years". There had been much research done on Kyivan Rus' by historians such as Ukrainian Mykhailo Hrushevsky, who wrote the book "Ukraine-Rus," and Russian Igor Danilevsky, whose research is not under the misleading influence of the Russian Empire. Now, more about the beginnings of Rus'. Vikings from the north had settled the lands of what was to become Rus' which were already inhabited by Slavic tribes. The Rurik Dynasty was then established as a Viking state founded by Rurik (the legitimacy of Rurik as a person could be a myth), which quickly turned into Rus', whose founder is thought to be Viking Oleh. Around this time, Ukraine's emblem and coat of arms, the Tryzub (trident), appeared. The influence of the ruling class of Rus' eventually became clearly Slavic when names of Norse origin, such as "Oleh" were replaced by Slavic "Sviatoslav" and "Volodymyr", but Viking influence remained throughout Rus', such as the bloodline of the Rurik Dynasty. The state of Rus' contained many different settlements, mostly of Slavs but also of Baltic, Finno-Ugric, and Turkic people. For this reason, Rus' was never fully united and had many rivalries, but it still managed to become powerful economically and had led many victorious battles, some of which led to the downfall of the Khazar and Bulgarian powers. The predominant language of Rus' became Old East Slavic (Old Church Slavonic in literary form) or Old Ukrainian, which was also the language used in Slavic states after the collapse of Kyivan Rus'. The Ukrainian language has its origins in the state of Kyivan Rus'. Sviatoslav Ihorovych, son of Olha and Ihor, was one of the last pagan rulers before Christianity completely took over Rus'. Volodymyr the Great officially baptized and converted Rus' to Christianity in 988, which led to the deaths of thousands and influenced the language and culture of Rus' and future Eastern Slavs, who are today mostly identified as Orthodox Christians; this is seen as Volodymyr's greatest achievement. Yaroslav the Wise, son of Volodymyr, became grand prince of Kyiv after Volodymyr, one of the first mentions of the title "Grand Prince" and he continued to advance the statefulness of Rus' by building temples and libraries. Yaroslav became a large influence in Europe when his children became rulers of other European states, such as Anna Yaroslavna, who became queen of France. Yaroslav's sons, Iziaslav, Sviatoslav, and Vsevolod, then became grand princes of Rus'. The next well-known and influential prince of Rus' became Volodymyr Monomakh, who worked on unifying Rus'. Monomakh had eight children who continued to rule the principalities of Rus'. One of Monomakh's children was Yuri Dolhorukiy, who was then sent to rule the "far corner" of Rus' because nobody wanted him ruling the main areas of Kyiv. Only then in 1147 was "Moscow" mentioned, with the origins of its name translating to "mud river" or "mud city" its founders being Dolhorukiy, and it became an influential city by Boholyubskiy, the capital of today's Russia, as well as other cities of today's Russia, were founded in the 11th and 12th centuries in the same area, such as Suzdal' and Vladimir. These cities became known as the area of "Zalissya" which roughly translates as "beyond the forests", In the Chronicles of Rus' this area was barely considered part of Rus', most of the inhabitants in this area at the time were Finno-Ugric people. According to Hrushevsky, "Dolhorukiy was hated by the people of Kyiv; his burial was not even wanted by his father, Monomakh; instead, he was buried in the area he had ruled, the area 'beyond'". Andriy Boholyubskiy, son of Dolhorukiy, continued to rule over Zalissya and even led violent raids against the heartland of Rus', Kyiv. Rus' fell apart around the year 1240 CE due to internal conflicts and the Mongol invasion, which devastated the cities of Rus', including the capital, Kyiv. Rus' broke apart into many different principalities, one of which is Halychyna (Ruthenia) or Halychyna-Volhynia.</p>

            <img src="Великий_герб_Львова.png" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Halychyna After the Collapse of Kyivan Rus'</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">After the collapse of Rus', Halychyna (the Kingdom of Halych or Halych-Volhynia), known in Latin as "Ruthenia", took the role as main principality due to the absolute ruin left in Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Pereiaslav after the Mongol invasion. This kingdom is considered by some to be one of the first distinctly Ukrainian states. People in Halych, as well as in other principalities, called themselves "Rusyny, Rusynamy," which is an earlier name for Ukrainians. The main reason for the transition of Rusyny to Ukrainians was because of the renaming of Moscow and the Muscovites to Russia and Russians, which would avoid confusion, but also because the Rusyns called their land "Ukraine" at the time and saw it as logical to call themselves Ukrainians. The Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko even referred to himself as a Rusyn at times while calling his land Ukraine. Using "Ukrainian" to refer to people was evident even back to the times of the Cossacks in the 17th century, but the name started to become widespread during the "Ukrainian National Revival" of the 19th century. Today, the name Rusyny is most commonly used in the Ukrainian Carpathians and parts of Poland and Slovakia. It was also in Halychyna when the well-known colors of Ukraine, yellow and blue, appeared and started to symbolize the lands of Ukraine. The "Ruthenian Lion" was seen around the time of Rus'; the lion itself is yellow and the background is blue; this lion became a symbol closely associated with Halychyna, Ukraine, and the creation of another major Ukrainian city, Lviv, which was founded during the rule of Halychyna by its prince Danylo Romanovych. The first mention of the city of Halych was in around 898 CE, and the first prince of a Halych principality was Volodar Rostyslavych in the year 1084. In around the year 1199, two different principalities of Rus', Halych and Volhynia, successfully combined (after previous failed attempts) to create Halych-Volhynia, a large territory also called the Kingdom of Rus'. In 1204, the principality of Kyiv became the territories of Halych-Volhynia under the rule of Roman Mstyslavych, who was then titled the "Grand Prince of Rus'". Succesor of Mstyslavych became his son, Danylo Romanovych, who became the first king of Halychyna and overall Rus'. Romanovych is one of the most well-known names today due to his contribution to Ukrainian history by fighting enemies on all fronts (mainly the Golden Horde, Hungary, Poland, and Lithuania) as well as founding one of Ukraine's most well-known cities, Lviv, named after Romanovychy's son, Lev, which means "lion". Romanovych made Kholm the capital city of his kingdom after Halych was devastated by the Mongols; later, the capital became Lviv in 1272. In 1253, Romanovych was crowned and gained the title "King of all Rus'". In the following years, he continued to defend his kingdom. Danylo Romanovych remained the most influential ruler of Halychyna. Halychyna became part of Lithuania in the 14th century. The lands of Ruthenia kept its name throughout history.</p>

            <img src="Polish-Lithuanian.png" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Ruthenia, Lithuania, and Poland</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">The lands of Halychyna were absorbed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 14th century. Rusyny continued to live on their land inside the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Cossacks appeared around the 14th century on the lands of Lithuania and the steppes, where they started to form a Cossack Zaporizhian state. More about the Cossacks will come later. Most of Lithuanian land was made up of today's Ukrainian and Belarusian lands; this had a large influence on the ruling class of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where many Ruthenian families intermarried with Lithuanian families. The region of past Ruthenia became known as the Lithuanian-Ruthenian state inside the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by today's historians. Lithuania continued expanding and fighting wars, mainly with Muscovy and Tatars. Lithuania and Poland had participated in numerous alliances throughout their history; this eventually led to the creation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth played a large role in Ukrainian history since much of its land was in today's Ukrainian lands. The commonwealth's ruling class was mostly from the Polish bloodline, including its first ruler, Augustus. Poland has influenced Ukraine in many ways throughout history, including their influence on the Ukrainian language. The Ukrainian language has borrowed many words from the Polish language, and sometimes those words would in turn be borrowed from the German language. Throughout the period of the commonwealth, Ukrainians and Poles had a very difficult and sometimes bloody relationship. The Polish nobility were foul toward the people of the Ruthenian land, the Cossacks, and peasants. The Cossacks were hoping to create an autonomous state and separate from Poland due to injustice towards their people—a state consisting of the lands of former Ruthenia. Poland would not allow freedom for those people, causing a major war between Poles and Ukrainians. In around the year 1648, the Khmelnytsky Uprising began. Cossacks revolted against the commonwealth with the final goal of creating a Ruthenian state once again. The revolt succeeded with the help of other nations and ended around 1657. For a short time, a new state called the Cossack Hetmanate had risen under the revolt's leader, Khmelnytsky, who today is considered the father of Ukraine. More about this event will be said in a later section. The Cossack state had been under constant war and eventually became part of Poland and Muscovy after enjoying a short period of freedom. More about the Cossacks and their states will come next. The Ukrainian lands of Rus' had shifted from Poland to Muscovy in the late 18th century. The main enemies of Ukraine at the time were Poland, Muscovy, and the Ottoman Empire, who were all also allies of the Cossacks at certain times. While all other enemies were fighting for power, Ukrainians were fighting for freedom.</p>

            <img src="UkrainianCossacks.jpg" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Ukrainian Cossacks</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">Ukrainian Cossacks, their dances, the folk songs they left us, the cities they built, and their love for freedom are today one of the largest symbols of the Ukrainian identity. Nobody can be sure where the Cossacks came from, but they appeared around the 14th or 15th century on the steppes. The Cossacks divided into multiple different groups; one group became Ukrainian Cossacks (Zaporizhian Cossacks and the Cossacks of the Hetmanate) on today's Ukrainian lands and later in the historically Ukrainian Kuban'. However, there was a large difference between Ukrainian and other Cossacks; other Cossacks, such as the Don Cossacks, which are today recognized as Russian, were mercenaries to the Russian Empire, part of an army, and people who followed commands, while Ukrainian Cossacks were the people of their own state. Because Ukrainian Cossacks had their own state, they had to defend it, and they did; they gave up their lives to create what is today Ukraine. Cossack history is very complex at first. Their enemies were the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Muscovy, and the Ottoman Empire, but somehow these enemies were all also allies at some point. Ukrainians fought on one of their enemies sides, which were most likely to give Ukraine sovereignty; in the end, it was the Crimean Tatars who helped in the creation of the new Cossack state of the Hetmanate. Some well-known names of Ukrainian Cossack leaders who fought for an independent Ukraine are Dmytro Bayda Vyshnevetsky, Petro Sahaidachny, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Ivan Sirko, Petro Doroshenko, Ivan Bohun, Ivan Pidkova, Pylyp Orlyk, and Ivan Mazepa. Much of Ukraine's cultural identity comes from the Cossacks. The Oseledets is a Ukrainian haircut seen since the times of Rus', but it became especially common among the Cossacks. The iconic Ukrainian dance, Hopak, originated with the Zaporizhian Cossacks. When heading into battle, Cossacks would dance on the battlefield; they even used some of their dance moves in the Cossack martial arts along with a sword. Today, the Combat Hopak is practiced in Ukraine and other countries. It is a martial art based on the fighting style of the Cossacks. Many Ukrainian folk songs came from the Cossacks. Today, these folk songs are a crucial part of Ukrainian history and the understanding of Ukrainian history since they sing about what had been happening during those times. Ukrainian folkloric hero Cossack Mamay is known for holding a Kobza (a Ukrainian folk instrument) and singing Ukrainian songs. Kobzars are Ukrainian Cossacks who would travel and sing Ukrainian folk songs. Cossacks and their wives loved singing so much that Ukraine became the nation with the largest number of folk songs (200,000+). Cossacks continued building Ukraine and founded large cities in the Cossack capital region of the Sich. Ukrainian Cossacks are also the people who are thought to have created one of the first constitutions in the world and one of the first democracies in Europe. Cossacks had a love for freedom, which today's Ukrainians have inherited. While Ukraine was a name used during the times of Rus', it went out of use during Lithuanian and Polish occupation of Ukraine, but the name was revived and again made widespread by the Cossacks, who had called their land Ukraine and their state Hetmanshchyna. Ukrainian Cossacks are fascinating and an important part of Ukrainian history inspiring many throughout history around the world; today they are known for their strength, their values of freedom, and their culture.</p>

            <img src="UkrainianKozaky.jpg" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Ukrainian Cossack States</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">There were two main parts of the Ukrainian Cossack state called the Cossack Hetmanate, Hetmanshchyna, or the Zaporozhian Host: Zaporizhzhia (southern lands) and the rest of the Cossack Hetmanate. Hetmans were the leaders of the Cossack state. Zaporizhzhia was part of the Cossack Hetmanate when it was founded, but it had a different government and different Hetman leaders. The earliest Cossack state, the Zaporozhian Sich, appeared in 1552 and was founded by Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, also known as simply Bayda. Bayda became known as the first Cossack hetman and remained an important figure for the Cossacks. The Zaporozhian Sich stands today as a historical site on Khortytsia Island, Ukraine. Over the years, the Cossacks would engage in battle with the Tatars and later with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth before the creation of the Hetmanate state. The Cossacks would fight under the commonwealth for a while as a separate section of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth; however, the Polish nobility were awful toward the Cossacks and the people on Ukrainian lands, which led to multiple rebellions and eventually war with the commonwealth and the Cossacks. Multiple hetmans have fought in hopes of creating a separate Cossack state, but the most successful was Bohdan Khmelnytsky, leader of the Cossack Uprising (Cossack-Polish War) in 1648–1657. Khmelnytsky had led multiple successful battles against the Polish forces and driven the Poles away from Ruthenian land. The Cossacks gained help from the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate in achieving victory. The official founding date of the Cossack Hetmanate is 1649. Early battles of Zhovti Vody (Yellow Waters, 1648) and Battle of Pyliavtsi (1648) were some of the most successful Cossack victories. It is obvious the Polish nobility were caught by surprise, but eventually Poland gained victories in the years 1650-1651 and continued fighting the Cossacks. The Cossacks did not give up; they kept fighting. The fighting has never truly stopped during the years of the Hetmanate; even after the Hetmanate, Ukrainians continued fighting for an independent country. The Pereiaslav Treaty of 1654 led to collaborations between the Ukrainian Cossacks and Muscovites, which led to more victories against the Poles. Today, this treaty is recognized as a large mistake by Ukrainian historians and has created criticism of Khmelnytsky because it led to future difficulties and wars with the Muscovites and was even used as propaganda during the Soviet Union to call Ukraine part of Russia. Muscovy soon became a disappointment to Khmelnytsky when he realized Muscovy was planning to incorporate Cossack lands into their empire; this led to chaotic fighting among the Polish, Cossack, and Muscovite forces. The end of the Khmelnytsky Uprising came in 1657 with the death of Khmelnytsky. Khmelnytsky remained an important part of Ukrainian history, and with the creation of modern Ukraine, a city and region of Ukraine were named Khmelnytsky, after the Cossack leader. The Cossack forces under the new Hetmans continued fighting enemy nations that surrounded the Cossack Hetmanate. Khmelnytsky's son, Yurii, was chosen as the successor of the Hetmanate. At this point, the Hetmanate was divided between Poland and Muscovy. Some Cossacks were on the side of Poland, and the others were on the side of Muscovy. Other Cossacks were on neither side and fought both nations; this period became known as "The Ruin". The best example of this is Hetman Petro Doroshenko, who led multiple successful attacks on both forces. Heading towards the early 1700s, Baturyn was the capital of the Cossacks, and the two best known Cossack leaders at this time were Ivan Mazepa and Pylyp Orlyk. Mazepa is a name that became known all around the world; he was an incredible hetman of Ukraine from around the years 1687 to his death in 1709. Mazepa continued to fight for the lands of Ukraine against Muscovy and is known for his alliance with the Swedish king, Charles XII. After Mazepa, Orlyk was elected hetman. Orlyk and Mazepa were great allies and knew each other well; they both fled to the city of Bender, where Mazepa eventually passed away. Orlyk is most known for writing the first constitution of Ukraine (one of the earliest, if not the earliest, in Europe) in 1710, the Constitution of Bendery. The name "Ukraine" was clearly stated in the constitution to refer to Cossack lands; it separated the three sections of government, gave restrictions to the Hetman of Ukraine, and made sure to write out the rights of the citizens of Ukraine; it was a strong, clear symbol of democracy. This constitution became a large symbol of Ukraine and Ukraine's past. While the battles with Poland and Muscovy had been happening in the north, the Cossacks of the south had another large enemy, the Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate. Ivan Sirko is possibly one of the most well-known names as a Cossack military leader who has led Cossacks through multiple battles, mainly against the Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate, but he also fought on the French side in the Franco-Spanish Thirty Years' War and Poles in the Cossack-Polish War, and he was successful in every single battle. This is true; Sirko won every battle that he arranged, and for this reason he became known as one of the strongest military leaders in history. Sirko is also known for helping write The "Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks" to the Sultan, who wanted the Cossacks to become part of their empire; Sirko declined this in one of the most humorous ways possible. The Cossack Hetmanate was officially dissolved in 1764 by Catherine II of Russia. Ukrainian Cossacks, however, had not dissapeared; they are the ancestors of Ukrainians, and many Ukrainians have definite Cossack heritage and last names. Ukrainian Cossacks, Ukraine, have some of the most fascinating stories in the world, in the form of words and music. The Cossacks have done a lot. Today, their spirit lives on in Ukrainians. Ukrainian Cossacks had a large influence around the world, and today they are remembered for their dances, folk songs, food, clothes, bravery, and their fight for freedom, for Ukraine.</p>

            <p class="BriefParagraph">After the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was dissolved, Ukrainian lands were divided between the Russian, Austrian, and Hungarian empires (which later became the Austro-Hungarian Empire). Ukrainians became minorities in these nations. The name "Ukrainian" for a person that lives on Ruthenian lands is now widespread at this point. Ukrainians kept their culture and language alive while inside these empires. Despite oppression and Russification from the Russian Empire and serfdom, they never stopped fighting for the idea of freedom and a separate state. In the late 19th century began a period of mass emigration of Ukrainians; they immigrated mostly to countries in the Americas and some in Asia. Today, Ukrainians have established their own communities in countries such as Canada, the United States, and Brazil. This period of time was named the "Ukrainian National Revival" because many Ukrainians started acting to create a free Ukrainian state. Another reason for the name is because some of the most influential Ukrainians were active during this time; they participated in some way to create a free Ukraine. These Ukrainians include Ivan Kotliarevsky, known as the founder of modern Ukrainian literature; Taras Shevchenko, a poet and artist known for his publication of poems "Kobzar"; Lesya Ukrainka, a Ukrainian activist symbol and writer; Mykola Lysenko, known as the founder of Ukrainian classical music; and Ivan Franko, a name of a poet, writer, philosopher, and more, known all around the world; he also has a city and region named after him in Ukraine. These are just a few names; Ukrainians of this time period had a huge influence on today's modern Ukrainian writing and many new creations of plays, music, and art. Scientific, historic, and other educational fields were also greatly expanded by Ukrainians during this time period. Heading towards the beginning of the 20th century, the Ukrainian National Revival had a huge influence, and when war started in Eastern Europe (the Russian Civil War and World War One), Ukrainians decided they had to step up, and because of the events of the Ukrainian National Revival, Ukrainians knew exactly what they were fighting for, as did the Cossacks. The tactic of asking peacefully for freedom as used during the Ukrainian National Revival was no longer an option with the Russians (the Austro-Hungarian Empire was much better to the Ukrainians), and when evil such as the Russian Empire was controlling Ukrainian land, unfortunately, it seemed that the only way towards freedom was militarily. Ukrainian military groups such as the Ukrainian People's Army of the UNR, the Makhnovists of the Black Army, and the army of Kholodny Yar had formed in the early 20th century to fight for the Ukrainian identity and culture.</p>

            <p class="BriefParagraph">The Russian Empire was falling apart in the early twentieth century, which gave way for Ukrainians to call for the creation of their own state or territory. Some Ukrainian groups that were created in the 18th century in the midst of war wanted a Ukrainian state, while other groups wanted Ukrainian territory with Ukrainian influence (schools in the Ukrainian language, etc.), not a state; that group is the anarchists. When World War One started, there were Ukrainians fighting on the side of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and others on the side of the Russian Empire, but most Ukrainians, having spent years under the oppression of other nations, wanted complete sovereignty and freedom. The most recognized names of organizations set up during the Russian Civil War, also called the Ukrainian War of Independence when thinking about the territories of Ukraine, were the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) and their army, the Ukrainian People's Army, the Ukrainian Hetmanate state set up by the Germans, the Makhnovists of the anarchist Black Army, and the Kholodny Yar Republic, who are today seen as one of the most heroic people of Ukraine. The UNR was founded around 1917–1918 as an independent state, which lasted until about 1921. The first president of the Rada of the UNR (council) became Mykhailo Hrushevsky, an important figure for Ukraine today. The top military commander of the UNR army was Symon Petliura; as a result, the Muscovites (Russians) began calling Ukrainians Petliuryvtsi (Petliura people). Petliura is seen as an important figure in the fight for Ukrainian independence today; he fought mostly against the Muscovite forces of the Red and White armies. Ukrainians of the UNR are referred to as the heroic Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Stril'tsi). The Ukrainian Hetmanate State was a short-lived state set up by the Germans, with its hetman being Pavlo Skoropadsky, who has Cossack heritage. His Cossack heritage being the reason Skoropadsky was named "Hetman", a name for a Cossack leader used during the Hetmanate state of Ukraine in the 17th century. Skoropadsky's state fell apart when Skoropadsky realized Germany was losing World War One, and he fled Ukrainian land at that point, making the UNR once again the state of the territory of Ukraine. The Black Army, or Makhnovshchyna, was led by Nestor Makhno, an anarchist. Having anarchist ideologies, the Black Army did not want to create a Ukrainian state; in fact, they opposed the idea of a Ukrainian state and the UNR. Makhno had an alliance with the Red Army for some time until they betrayed him, making the White and Red armies Makhno's main enemies. Destroying the Whites was Makhno's focus. Makhno is known for his slogan "Beat the Whites until they're Red, beat the Reds until they're White". Makhno, and especially his wife, Halyna Kuzmenko, wanted a "safe" Ukrainian community with Ukrainian influence, Ukrainian schools, education in the Ukrainian language, and the spread of Ukrainian identity and Ukrainian history. So, most of what the Black Army wanted is what the other Ukrainian states have wanted to accomplish, just with the large difference of Ukrainian territory not being a state. Makhno's territory was named the "Free Territory of Makhno". Today in Ukraine, there are mixed views about Makhno, but for the most part, he is respected for wanting to create a Ukrainian community. One of the most heroic people for Ukrainians today are the fighters of Kholodny Yar, along with the UNR Sich Riflemen and the World War II Rebels (Povs'tantsi). Kholodny Yar was the final Ukrainian state before Ukrainian lands became part of the Soviet Union. Kholodny Yar fought until the end, day and night in the forests; their slogan was "Freedom for Ukraine or Death!", Death was better than living without Ukraine. Today in Ukraine's army, the 93rd Brigade is named Kholodny Yar in honor of Kholodny Yar of the 1920s. Ukraine, after the UNR, Hetmanate, Free Territory, and Kholodny Yar, became a republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 with many difficulties and fighting to come.</p>

            <img src="holodomor.jpg" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Ukraine in the Soviet Union Before World War II</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">The territory of Ukraine became known as the "Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic" or "Ukrainian SSR" inside the Soviet Union. Many Ukrainians, those who had fallen for communist propaganda, were for communism at the time; others did not enjoy the fact that Russia was the "main" country in the union. The Soviet Union was a union of fifteen communist states: Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Russia was seen as the most important country in the union and the one that "needs to take control", so it did, and Russia became the leading country in the union. This way of viewing the union was mostly started by the Russians themselves and later managed to spread to a few in the surrounding countries (when it comes to Ukraine, the east and south were mostly influenced by the idea of Russia being the "greater country"). Ukrainization started in Ukraine with the permission of the "leader", Russia, who hoped Ukrainians would gain more trust in the Soviet Union and its leadership by allowing Ukrainization. The Ukrainian language and culture were encouraged on the areas of Ukraine, and while the history of Ukrainian organizations such as Kholodny Yar and Makhnovshchyna was quieted down, the oppression that the Soviet Union became known for has not yet begun. However, not all Ukrainians liked the idea of Russia being under the control of Ukraine; as if the times of the Russian Empire and Muscovy hadn't changed, some Ukrainians would think: first Muscovy (Russia) would promise something, such as the Pereiaslav Treaty of 1654 and Ukrainization, then they would betray Ukraine and devastate it, as it did with the Cossacks and probably will do with that time Ukraine. The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) was founded in Vienna, Austria, in 1929 with the goal of creating a Ukrainian state. In the 1930s, OUN had led multiple missions, such as the assassinations of people who they viewed as enemies of Ukraine and who had been blocking the way of creating a free Ukrainian state. They took extreme measures when they needed to reach their goals. The main targets of the OUN in the 1930s were the Polish, who took part in fighting against Ukraine and later the "Pacification" of Ukraine. Poland had also claimed western Ukrainian land, the OUN wanted to reclaim that land (making Poles enemies). The OUN became especially active during World War II. Meanwhile, Stalin had ended Ukrainization and started oppressions against Ukraine and other Soviet republics. One of the worst events in Ukrainian history took place in 1932–1933: a famine created by Stalin's leadership that claimed the lives of millions of Ukrainians. This was genocide. Ukraine experienced three major famines: earlier in 1921–1923, the Holodomor in 1932–1933, which is considered the "worst one", and later in 1946–1947. Russification had once again begun on Ukrainian lands under Stalin's rule, just as it had been during the times of Muscovy and the Russian Empire (17th–19th century). Leading up to and during World War II, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) played a crucial role in Ukrainian lands and Ukrainian history.</p>

            <img src="OUN-r_Flag_1941.svg.png" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Ukraine During World War II</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">When World War II started, there were Ukrainians fighting on multiple sides of the battlefield, with the Soviets, with the Germans, and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) against everyone. By the 1930s, differences in outlook had appeared in the OUN: some in the UON were pragmatic realists who thought in terms of traditional militaristic authoritarianism, whereas the younger members were integral nationalists who espoused a romantic, irrational devotion to the nation. These ideological differences contributed ultimately to the split in the organization in 1940. The split created the OUN-M, led by Andriy Melnyk and consisting of mostly older members, and the OUN-B, led by Stepan Bandera and consisting of mostly younger members. The OUN's membership consisted overwhelmingly of students and young people. There are no reliable figures, but estimates range as high as 20,000 (1939). Yet the OUN's influence greatly exceeded its size. Its spirit of selfless, even fanatical, dedication to the national cause proved tremendously attractive to young people. The OUN can be said to have shaped the political outlook of an entire generation of Western Ukrainians. Ukrainians had enough of Russia, Poland, and now Germany (who were allies at first but quickly became enemies) controlling their land and ruining their daily lives. Ukrainians want to see their beautiful culture without the fear of execution. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) was created in 1942 and organized by Taras Borovets and later OUN factions. They fought mainly against the Soviets and Nazis. UPA was represented by the Ukrainian red and black flag representing Ukrainian blood darkening the rich Ukrainian soil, these war colors date back to the times of the Cossacks. UPA is remembered by Ukrainians for all the lives they gave up in the difficulty of protecting Ukraine. Some say if it wasn't for the OUN or UPA, Ukraine would not have existed as it does today, and Ukrainians would've been completely Polonized or Russified. The OUN, however, did make some mistakes that they were unable to foresee. The OUN members allied with Germany for some time in hopes of defeating the Soviets, who had always been the main enemy, but the OUN soon realized that Germany had no intentions of making Ukraine an independent country, making the Germans enemies. Criticizing the OUN for this alliance is unreasonable; the OUN were not Nazis and did not follow their ideology; they were nationalists who wanted nothing more than to create a Ukrainian state. Only later did the OUN realize that Nazi Germany was the same as Russia. It is because OUN was fighting to create a Ukrainian state that the OUN and UPA soldiers were seen as heroes; the death of Jews is recognized by Ukrainians and condemned, but the death of Ukrainians fighting to preserve the Ukrainian identity is also recognized and remembered. The "Volyn massacre" led to the deaths of thousands of Poles by Ukrainians and, later, Ukrainians by Poles. These attacks were performed by the UPA on Ukrainian land because of their (Poles and Ukrainians) already existing tensions. The tensions between Ukraine and Poland claimed about 35,000 Polish lives and 15,000 Ukrainian lives; the number of Polish dead reaching 100,000, as claimed by some Poles, is unrealistic. It is once again important to remember that the UPA was looking to create a Ukrainian state and protect the Ukrainian identity, not commit murder on purpose. Ukrainians and Poles, as well as all other victims of the confusion of World War II, have apologized to one another (as countries and governments) and hope to live peacefully. In the autumn of 1944, the Germans released Stepan Bandera, Andriy Melnyk, and other nationalist leaders in a belated attempt to win support for their war effort. At the end of the war, Melnyk resumed his leadership of the OUN(M); Bandera and Yaroslav Stetsko were elected to the leadership in Ukraine. In February 1946, the External Units of the OUN were formed in Munich under Bandera's leadership, and in April, the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations was set up by Stetsko to unify non-Russian nationalities opposed to the Soviet regime. Ukrainian OUN and UPA soldiers continued fighting Soviet occupation and Polish hopes of gaining Ukrainian territory after World War II. The Ukrainian call "Slava Ukraini" (Glory to Ukraine) and reply "Heroyam Slava" (Glory to the heroes) were used especially during the times of OUN and UPA. Stepan Bandera is probably the most recognized name to Ukrainians for his fight for an independent Ukraine; he quotes: "The time will come when one will say, 'Glory to Ukraine!', and millions will answer 'Glory to the heroes!'". Today, Bandera's quote is true. After Stalin's death in 1953, war on Ukrainian lands quieted down, and more peaceful approaches to gaining independence continued in Ukraine.</p>

            <img src="StusHorynKyivdissidents.jpg" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Ukraine Leading Up to its Independence</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">The period leading up to Ukraine's independence was much more peaceful, although Russification was still happening. There were peaceful protests in Ukraine leading up to its independence. The dissident movement came into existence in the USSR after the death of Joseph Stalin. It protested against violations of the law by organs of the state and demanded national and human rights and adherence to the constitutions of the USSR and the Union republics. In Ukraine, as in other republics of the USSR where national oppression was keenly felt, the dissident movement represented a struggle against the violation of the republic's rights to sovereignty by the central government and the Communist Party, a resistance to colonization by foreign elements and to the resettlement of Ukrainians outside Ukraine, and a protest against the destruction of cultural monuments, the falsification of the history of Ukraine, and generally against the policies of Russification. For many dissidents, the movement also represented a struggle for political rights. Ukrainian poets, writers, artists, singers, and everybody who cared about Ukraine took to the streets. Student protests on the Maidan, where students would not eat. Protestors, such as Vasyl Makukh, would light themselves on fire to spread their message of an independent Ukraine. Ukrainian protestors: Lina Kostenko, Vasyl Symonenko, Ivan Drach, Vitalii Korotych, Mykola Vinhranovsky, Valerii Shevchuk, Ivan Dziuba, Yevhen Sverstiuk, Ivan Svitlychny, and later Vasyl Stus, Mykhailo Osadchy, Ihor Kalynets, and Iryna Kalynets. These writers were joined in the creative resurgence of the 1960s by such scholars, publicists, philosophers, and artists as Viacheslav Chornovil, Valentyn Moroz, Alla Horska, Opanas Zalyvakha, and Mykola Lukash. As harbingers of the idea of creative freedom, these individuals became symbols of the Ukrainian national renaissance. In the 1980s and early 1990s, there were large-scale changes in international relations and the socio-economic and political development of the world. In developed capitalist countries, a new rise in the economy was observed. In the USSR, the economy was failing. The failing economy of the USSR eventually led to its collapse. Ukraine became an independent country on August 24, 1991.</p>

            <img src="Flag_of_Ukraine.svg.png" width="250px" height="165px"><h1 class="BriefTitle">Independent Ukraine</h1>
            <p class="BriefParagraph">There were tears of joy in Ukraine when it finally became independent; there was no forced Russification; there were no bans on Ukrainian culture and language; there was no more war; there was peace for a little while longer. However, Ukrainians soon realized the fight for Ukraine was not over, not nearly. Russian influence remained in eastern Ukraine, and Russification made a large impact on Ukraine. Due to Russification, most of Ukraine understood and could speak Russian; many Russians remained in eastern Ukraine, where Russification hit worst. Many Russians and even Russified Ukrainians believed Russia was the "greater country" and "greater language" and some were even afraid of speaking Ukrainian in eastern Ukraine. While western and central Ukraine were recovering from Russification and proudly speaking Ukrainian. Leonid Kravchuk became the first president of Ukraine in 1991. The Ukrainian government made a large mistake in 1994 during the signing of the Budapest Memorandum. Ukraine, having one of the largest nuclear supplies, would give all of its nuclear supply to Russia, Britain, and the United States in exchange for the security of Ukraine's independence and recognition of Ukraine's borders. Ukraine should have realized that Russia was not someone to negotiate with; unfortunately, the president at that time did not. Ukraine was more pro-Russian, again, because of Russia's influence during the Soviet Union. Kravchuk was a president who was not yet fully pro-Russian but was leaning towards Russia. The people of Ukraine, however, will never forget how they have been fighting Moscow for the last four hundred years, since the year 2000. After Kravchuk, Kuchma (1994–2005) and Yanukovych (2010–2014) led Ukraine as pro-Russian presidents, Yushchenko (2005–2010) led Ukraine without the influence of Russia; however, he was unable to improve the poor economy of Ukraine. Multiple protests were held against Kuchma due to his pro-Russian views, but all of them were stopped by the Ukrainian Berkut. When Yanukovych was elected as a result of corruption after Kuchma, a large peaceful protest broke out, the Orange Revolution; this protest was successful, and the much more accepted Yushchenko became president instead. However, Yanukovych did not disappear; he was elected once again in 2010 with the promise of leading Ukraine in the direction of Europe, not Russia. Yanukovych's promise was a blatant lie; he was supposed to sign a document with the EU to strengthen ties with the West, but he refused to at the last minute. The Ukrainian Euromaidan, or Revolution of Dignity, had begun against the pro-Russian government of Yanukovych and eventually led to violent fights and the deaths of the heroic "Heavenly Hundred," who are remembered today by Ukrainians. Yanukovych eventually fled Ukraine and lived in exile in Russia. The people and spirit of Ukraine won during the Revolution of Dignity, and the pro-Russian Ukrainian government was defeated. The same tears of joy as during the independence of Ukraine were felt among Ukrainians. Those tears of joy didn't last long. Russia would once again wage war against Ukraine in 2014, grossly breaking the promise of the Budapest Memorandum. They would illegally annex Crimea and support the people of the Donetsk People's Republic, who support Russia, again, increasing the influence of Russification in eastern Ukraine. Ukrainians started defending their identity, freedom, and democracy once again, as they have for the last hundreds of years. Presidents Poroshenko (2014–2019) and Zelenskyy (2019) were elected in the upcoming years. Ukraine had been fighting in the Donbas region for eight years when Russia made a "full-scale" invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. On February 24, Ukraine was not surprised. The world has started to look into Ukrainian history and culture. Ukraine becomes a name known around the world. The people of Ukraine stood up against Moscow and their attempt to once again try to destroy Ukraine and the Ukrainian identity. The Muscovites have never managed to and will never destroy Ukraine or its identity. Ukrainians had been a nation fighting for freedom since the very beginning and until the very end. As did the Cossacks, as did the Sich Riflemen of the UNR and the soldiers of Kholodny Yar, as did the rebels of the OUN and UPA, as did the protestors in the 1800s and late 20th century. Ukrainians are best characterized as people with a love of freedom. Слава Україні!</p>

This led up to the Battle of Poltava between Sweden, Cossacks, and Muscovites which resulted in a devastating loss for Sweden and Mazepa.</p>
